## Jabbrev

[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/fawda123/Jabbrev/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fawda123/Jabbrev/actions)

This R package converts a journal name (or any text) to abbreviations using the ISSN List of Title Word Abbreviations ([LTWA](https://www.issn.org/services/online-services/access-to-the-ltwa/), available as a [csv file](https://www.issn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ltwa_current.csv)).  Some journals insist that journal names in bibliographies are abbreviated.  This is dumb so here's a package that does it for you.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('fawda123/Jabbrev')
library(Jabbrev)
```

One journal at a time:
```{r message = F, echo = F, warning = F}
devtools::load_all(".")
```
```{r}
abbrev('Journal of Applied Mathematics')
```

Or convert a whole .bib file:
```{r cache = T}
bib_shr('inst/refs.bib')
```
